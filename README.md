DUNGEON DOUG. is a roguelike game inspired by The Legend of Zelda, Hades, and others. Developed in two weeks for a game development class, it combines a psuedo-procedurally-generated dungeon map with simple combat, strategy, and a set of abilities and attributes that the player chooses as they play.

To play, run \DUNGEON_DOUG_PORT\bin\Release\net8.0\win-x64\publish\DUNGEON_DOUG.exe
